Pick-Up Lines:-
________________
1. Are you a magician? It’s the strangest thing, but every time I look at you, everyone else disappears.
2. I hope you know CPR, because you just took my breath away!
3. Do you have a name, or can I just call you ‘mine’?
4. You’re so fine, you made me forget my pickup line.
5. I’m not sure if you’re a dream or a reality, but I’m not ready to wake up.
6. Are you a bank loan? Because you’ve got my interest.
7.
